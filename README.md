# Set MP3 metadata from filename
Take a song in **Artist name - Song title.mp3** format and change it to	**Song title** while setting the name and title in the metadata. 

Uses **id3v2** to manipulate metadata, so that must be installed. 
Add the files to the "Music" folder and call **python setMetadata.py**
